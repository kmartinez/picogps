# This takes 12.5 hours to run: to sve you the trouble here are results from one sample of Pyboard.

# Mean and standard deviation of RTC correction factors based on ten runs over different periods.
# Conclusion: for the best possible accuracy, run for 20 minutes. However a ten minute run gave
# a result within 2ppm (one minute/yr).
